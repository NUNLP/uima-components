SPECIMEN A: Left breast axillary node, level #1, cps 400
SPECIMEN B: Left axillary node #2, level 1, cps 450
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast Ca
SPECIMEN C: Left axillary sentinel node level 1, cps 710
SPECIMEN D: Left axillary  non-sentinel node #4
SPECIMEN E: Left breast lumpectomy
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A)  Left axillary level 1 sentinel lymph node (40 cps):
     - Lymph node with no evidence of tumor.
B)  Left axillary level 1 sentinel lymph node (450 cps):
     - Lymph node with no evidence of tumor.
C)  Left axillary sentinel lymph node (710 cps):
     - Lymph node with no evidence of tumor.
D)  Left axillary non-sentinel lymph node:
     - Lymph node with no evidence of tumor.
E)  Left breast, lumpectomy:
- Breast tissue with healing biopsy site, florid proliferative
breast disease and multifocal lobular carcinoma in-situ.
- No residual invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in-situ
identified.
COMMENT:  (E) The previous biopsies (GHS03-5466) are reviewed and
show ductal carcinoma in-situ and multiple foci of infiltrating of
carcinoma with features of infiltrating lobular carcinoma.  An exact
tumor size is difficult to ascertain, but is estimated at
approximately 1.5 cm.
