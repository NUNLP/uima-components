# This is the config file for GSpell. The values of this file
# are duplicated and instantiated for each dictionary.
#
# Some of these values can be altered for performance tuning
# after the dictionary is made. Performance tuning alterations 
# should be made in the configuration files for each dictionary 
#

# Performance tuning variables

#
#   CONSIDER_N_CANDIDATES 
#                   The number of candidates
#                   that can be evaluated for any given input.
#                   The higher the number the better the suggestions
#                   are, but the longer it takes to do.  A reasonable
#                   rate on a sun is about 2000. This corresponds to
#                   the --considerNCandidates= commandline option.
#
#       CACHE_SIZE  This is the number of grams to keep in memeory
#                   during processing. The more grams in memory, the
#                   faster the response is. This makes a real difference
#                   for indexing, where if you can keep all the grams
#                   in memory, the faster indexing will go. The downside
#                   is more memory is used. For indexing, this may
#                   mean bumping up the memory to something along the
#                   lines of 100mb for dictionaries of 100,000 terms or more.  
#                   This variable is used to keep the number of grams in
#                   memory to this size. The hash of grams does not grow beyond
#                   this number. Ideally, this size should not be set bigger
#                   than the number of grams you have. This corresponds
#                   with the --cacheSize= commandline option.
#    
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Variables that can be changed to give specific behaviors
# --------------------------------------------------------
#
#   TRUNCATE       This variable limits the number of suggestions returned
#                  for a given input. This corresponds with the --truncate= 
#                  commandline option.
#
#   MAX_EDIT_DISTANCE 
#                  This variable limits suggestions to those which have
#                  an edit distance equal to or less than this parameter.
#                  This corresponds with the --maxEditDistance= commandline option.
#
#WORD_LENGTH_HEURISTIC
#                  Set this to trim the candidates that are +/-4 characters different 
#                  in size than the query. This is useful for spelling suggestion
#                  but may get in the way when this application is used as
#                  a nearest neighbor suggestion application. 
#                  This corresponds with the --wordLengthHeuristic= commandline option.

# Variables that are set by the indexing and updating program and 
# should not be touched
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
#      NUMBER_OF_GRAMS The number of unique grams you dictionary has.
#  NUMBER_OF_DOCUMENTS The number of terms your dictionary has.
#       MAX_REFERENCES The number of terms that have the most popular gram has.
#     TOTAL_REFERENCED The number of documents referenced summed up for each gram 
#       AVG_REFERENCED The average number of documents referenced for any particular
#                      gram.
